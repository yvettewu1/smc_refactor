# SPI Monitor Implementation Plan

## Lifecycle Justification

The SPI monitor API is intentionally lifecycle-driven:

- `Uninitialized` -> hardware not yet programmed
- `Configured` -> policy tables and control fields staged and validated
- `Locked` -> write-disable bits asserted; runtime policy is immutable

This is not only an API preference. It is required by hardware behavior and
minimal-TCB goals.

### Why explicit lifecycle states are required

1. One-way hardware lock semantics
- SPIPF lock bits are effectively write-once for the boot/runtime session.
- If code can call lock-related operations out of order, policy may become
  partially programmed and permanently stuck.

2. Prevent unsafe intermediate exposure
- Programming command/region tables takes multiple writes.
- Without a staged `Configured` phase and explicit validation, a task could
  start using the monitor while rules are incomplete.

3. Enforce least-privilege steady state
- The expected runtime posture is read-mostly, policy-stable operation.
- Requiring a transition to `Locked` formalizes that post-boot mutable control
  is not part of normal operation.

4. Constrain bug blast radius in trusted code
- A typed lifecycle blocks classes of misuse at compile-time and runtime:
  - lock before tables are written
  - reprogram after lock
  - skipping readback checks

5. Improve auditability and attestation
- Lifecycle boundaries provide clear checkpoints for logs and tests:
  - "policy applied"
  - "policy verified"
  - "policy locked"
- This supports security review and incident triage.

### Operational model implied by lifecycle

- Boot/provisioning code owns transitions from `Uninitialized` to `Configured`.
- A validation gate (readback and invariants) is required before `Locked`.
- Runtime code consumes status from the locked monitor but does not mutate it.
- Any future "update mode" must be an explicit, authenticated state machine,
  not ad-hoc writes to locked policy tables.

Said differently: the intended operational model is static configuration after
bring-up. The SPI monitor should be programmed during trusted initialization,
verified, and then treated as read-only policy state for the remainder of the
session. This applies both to policy tables and to SCU-backed routing or
passthrough choices associated with the monitor.

The current repository scaffold is not yet the full enforcement point for that
rule. The typestate API already models `Configured` and `Locked` as distinct
states, but some raw register access remains exposed while register coverage and
precise lock semantics are still being finished. That gap should be treated as
an implementation TODO, not as permission to rely on dynamic post-lock
reconfiguration.

### Test implications

- Unit tests: verify invalid transitions fail deterministically.
- Integration tests: verify lock permanence and no post-lock writes.
- Silicon validation: verify lock bits and policy table contents survive the
  full boot-to-runtime handoff window.

## Phase 1: Foundations

- Complete `registers.rs` accessors for required SPIPF registers.
- Stabilize public enums and errors in `types.rs`.
- Keep unsafe access contained to register constructor perimeter.

## Phase 2: Controller API

- Provide lifecycle API in `controller.rs`:
  - construct
  - apply policy
  - lock
  - read back status
- Validate transitions and lock semantics.
- Tighten raw register exposure so post-lock APIs become observational rather
  than mutating.

## Phase 3: Policy Model

- Introduce declarative policy object in `policy.rs`.
- Add predefined profiles in `profile.rs` for runtime and update modes.
- Add unit tests for policy encoding and bounds checks.

## Phase 4: Integration

- Hook monitor policy into trusted bring-up sequence.
- Add readback assertions in integration tests.
- Document silicon-only checks for lock permanence and routing behavior.
