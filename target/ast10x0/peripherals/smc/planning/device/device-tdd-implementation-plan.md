# Device Layer Auditable TDD Implementation Plan

Date: 2026-05-02
Scope: `target/ast10x0/peripherals/smc/device/flash.rs`

## 1. Objective

Close remaining device-layer parity gaps against aspeed-rust behavior using a
strict, auditable TDD workflow where each requirement is linked to tests,
implementation changes, and verifiable evidence.

## 2. TDD Governance Rules

1. RED first: every requirement starts with a failing test.
2. GREEN minimal: implement only what is needed to pass that test.
3. REFACTOR safe: improve structure only with full test pass.
4. One requirement per commit where practical.
5. No commit unless required build/test gates pass.

## 3. Requirement Set (Auditable IDs)

### DEV-PAR-001: Per-CS device capacity correctness
Requirement:
- `SpiNorFlash::{from_fmc_cs,from_spi_cs}` must validate `FlashConfig`
  against selected-CS capacity, not controller total capacity.

Acceptance Criteria:
- CS0 and CS1 constructors accept matching per-CS config.
- Mismatched per-CS capacity returns `SmcError::InvalidCapacity`.

### DEV-PAR-002: CS-relative read offset semantics
Requirement:
- `FlashDevice::read(offset, ...)` treats `offset` as device-local and
  applies selected CS base translation.

Acceptance Criteria:
- CS-local reads do not alias across CS windows.
- Bounds checks are enforced against selected-CS capacity.

### DEV-PAR-003: CS-relative command addressing
Requirement:
- Program/erase command address encoding uses device-local offsets with
  selected CS base semantics consistent with read path.

Acceptance Criteria:
- `program_page` and `erase_sector` target correct CS-local address space.
- No cross-CS address bleed.

### DEV-PAR-004: Verify large-buffer behavior
Requirement:
- `verify()` supports buffers larger than 256 bytes via chunked comparison.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Verify succeeds for multi-page inputs.
- Verify remains bounded and deterministic.

### DEV-PAR-005: Transfer mode policy explicitness
Requirement:
- Device layer transfer mode policy is explicit: either configurable or
  intentionally fixed to `Mode111` with documented rationale.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Public API/docs make policy explicit.
- Tests cover chosen behavior.

### DEV-PAR-006: Polling/timeout policy fidelity
Requirement:
- `wait_write_complete()` timeout/poll policy is documented and tested.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Timeout path deterministic and test-covered.
- Success path deterministic and test-covered.

| DEV-PAR-004 | host unit test in `smc/device/flash.rs` | `smc/device/flash.rs`, `peripherals/BUILD.bazel` | `bazelisk test //target/ast10x0/peripherals:smc_flash_encoding_test` (+ new verify test target if added) | test output + commit hash |
| DEV-PAR-005 | unit/integration test per selected policy | `smc/device/flash.rs`, docs | depends on selected policy | test output + commit hash |
| DEV-PAR-006 | timeout/success tests in device integration path | `smc/device/flash.rs` + test files | relevant QEMU test target(s) | test output + commit hash |

## 6. Mandatory Pre-Commit Gates

For each WP commit:
1. `bazelisk build --platforms=//target/ast10x0 //target/ast10x0/tests/smc:smc`
2. Run relevant RED/GREEN target from the traceability row.
3. If runtime path touched, run corresponding QEMU test target.
4. Do not commit if any required target fails.

- Date: 2026-05-02
- Req ID(s): DEV-PAR-001
- RED test added: `target/ast10x0/tests/smc/target_device_qemu_multi_cs_capacity.rs`
  (target `//target/ast10x0/tests/smc:smc_device_qemu_multi_cs_capacity_test`,
  tag `integration`).
- Commit hashes:
  - RED: `f6025a9` — `test(smc/device): add RED test for DEV-PAR-001 per-CS capacity`
  - GREEN: `f38f5e8` — `feat(smc/device): per-CS capacity validation (DEV-PAR-001)`
  - REFACTOR: skipped — `cs_config` has only two call sites
    (`SpiNorFlash::from_fmc_cs`, `SpiNorFlash::from_spi_cs`); the plan's
    "more than two callers" trigger for hoisting `cs_capacity_bytes` was
    not met.
- Build command + result:
  - `bazelisk build --platforms=//target/ast10x0 //target/ast10x0/tests/smc:smc`
    → `Build completed successfully`.
- Test command + result:
  - `bazelisk test --config=virt_ast10x0 --test_tag_filters= //target/ast10x0/tests/smc:smc_device_qemu_multi_cs_capacity_test //target/ast10x0/tests/smc:smc_device_qemu_multi_cs_test //target/ast10x0/tests/smc:smc_device_qemu_program_erase_test //target/ast10x0/tests/smc:smc_device_test`
    → all 4 PASS.
  - Pre-GREEN run of the RED target alone: `FAILED in 0.5s` (asserted
    failure on assertions 1 & 3 of the new test, where the constructor
    rejects a correctly-sized per-CS config because it compares
    against CS0+CS1 total).
  - Post-GREEN sanity: `bazelisk test //target/ast10x0/peripherals:smc_flash_encoding_test`
    → PASS (host stub `host_flash_mod.rs` updated to expose `cs_config`).
- Notes/risk:
  - Deviation from plan §3.1.5: `cs_capacity_bytes` helper in
    `helpers.rs` was *not* added in WP-1 because no GREEN call site
    needs it — `validate_capacity_cfg` uses the controller's
    `cs_config(cs)` accessor and compares full `FlashConfig` equality
    via the new `PartialEq`/`Eq` derive. WP-2 (DEV-PAR-002/003) will
    add `cs_capacity_bytes` when its `device_to_controller_offset`
    helper introduces a real caller.
  - `validate_capacity_cfg` now compares whole-`FlashConfig` rather
    than `capacity_mb` alone (plan suggested either is fine). Stricter:
    catches drift between init-time `SmcConfig.cs*` and facade-time
    `FlashConfig` in page/sector/clock fields too.
  - Status: PASS.

- Date: 2026-05-02
- Req ID(s): DEV-PAR-002, DEV-PAR-003
- RED test added: `target/ast10x0/tests/smc/target_device_qemu_multi_cs_offsets.rs`
  (target `//target/ast10x0/tests/smc:smc_device_qemu_multi_cs_offsets_test`,
  tag `integration`).
- Commit hashes:
  - RED: `053d548` — `test(smc/device): RED for DEV-PAR-002/003 CS-local offsets`

  - GREEN: `068c478` — `feat(smc/device): CS-local offset translation (DEV-PAR-002/003)`
  - REFACTOR: skipped — `device_to_controller_offset` is a single helper
    used only by `read`; `validate_range` already routes through
    `self.capacity_bytes()` which now returns per-CS, so the plan's
    "two-place validate_range" trigger for extracting `cs_validate_range`
    was not met.
- Build command + result:
  - `bazelisk build --platforms=//target/ast10x0 //target/ast10x0/tests/smc:smc`
    → `Build completed successfully`.
- Test command + result:

    → all 5 PASS.
  - Pre-GREEN run of the (refined) RED target alone: `FAILED in 0.5s`
    (asserts a per-CS bounds rejection the broken total-capacity check
    accepts).
  - Post-GREEN host sanity: `bazelisk test //target/ast10x0/peripherals:smc_flash_encoding_test`
    → PASS (host stub `host_flash_mod.rs` updated to expose
    `cs_capacity_bytes`).
- Notes/risk:
  - **RED tactic deviation (commit `64cd019`).** Plan §3.5 RED step 2
    asks for a content-separation assertion (CS1.read(0) ≠ CS0.read(0))
    or its addressing-math downgrade (raw read at controller-window
    `CS0_CAPACITY` matches `cs1.read(0)`). On QEMU's `ast1030-evb`
    neither form is deterministic: the CS1 line aliases the single
    attached `w25q80bl` model and the chip wraps for offsets beyond its
    1 MB size, so reads via the CS1 facade and raw reads at
    controller-window `CS0_CAPACITY` return the *same* bytes whether or
    not `device_to_controller_offset` is invoked. The deterministic
    testable surface of DEV-PAR-002/003 on this model is the per-CS
    bounds check (assertions 1, 3, 4 in the plan); the offset-translation
    invariant is restated structurally in
    `SpiNorFlash::device_to_controller_offset` and is exercised on every
    passing `cs1.read/program/erase` call (which would otherwise route
    to the wrong segment on real silicon). This deviation is the
    "downgrade" pathway the plan explicitly anticipates.
  - **Implementation deviation (commit `068c478`).** Plan §3.6 step 5
    instructs `program_page` / `erase_sector` to encode the on-wire
    address with `device_to_controller_offset`. Per the symptom analysis
    in plan §3 for WP-2 ("the address bytes encoded into the SPI command
    are device-local on the wire ... the *command* path is correct under
    the QEMU caveat") the on-wire address must remain device-local so
    the chip's address space matches the bytes it receives; only the
    segment-routed read path needs translation. `program_page` /
    `erase_sector` therefore continue to encode device-local offsets and
    inherit the per-CS bounds check from `validate_range` →
    `capacity_bytes` (now per-CS). `device_to_controller_offset` is
    invoked from `read` only.
  - **Helper added.** `helpers::cs_capacity_bytes(config, cs)` is added
    as the WP-1 audit log noted ("WP-2 will add `cs_capacity_bytes`
    when its `device_to_controller_offset` helper introduces a real
    caller"). Surfaced through `Smc<Ready>::cs_capacity_bytes`,
    `FmcReady::cs_capacity_bytes`, `SpiReady::cs_capacity_bytes`, and
    the `host_flash_mod` stubs.
  - Status: PASS.

- Date: 2026-05-02
- Req ID(s): DEV-PAR-004
- RED test added: three host unit tests in
  `target/ast10x0/peripherals/smc/device/flash.rs` (`mod tests`)
  exercising the new free helper `compare_chunked`:
  - `compare_chunked_matches_buffer_above_scratch_size` (1 KB match,
    chunk 256),
  - `compare_chunked_detects_mismatch_in_later_chunk` (1 KB with a
    single tampered byte at offset 800),
  - `compare_chunked_propagates_read_error` (closure returns
    `SmcError::Timeout`, helper must surface it).
  All three run under `//target/ast10x0/peripherals:smc_flash_encoding_test`.
- Commit hashes:
  - RED: `c538e15` — `test(smc/device): RED for DEV-PAR-004 large-buffer verify`
  - GREEN: `9a3cf8f` — `feat(smc/device): chunked verify for arbitrary lengths (DEV-PAR-004)`
  - REFACTOR: skipped — `compare_chunked` has exactly one caller
    (`SpiNorFlash::verify`); the plan's "reuse chunk helper for future
    read/compare paths" trigger has no concrete second caller, so
    extraction beyond what GREEN already does would be speculative and
    out of scope per §0.
- Build command + result:
  - `bazelisk build --platforms=//target/ast10x0 //target/ast10x0/tests/smc:smc`
    → `Build completed successfully` (post-RED and post-GREEN).
- Test command + result:
  - Pre-GREEN run on RED commit (`c538e15`):
    `bazelisk test //target/ast10x0/peripherals:smc_flash_encoding_test`
    → `FAILED in 0.0s`. Failure detail: 17 prior tests pass; the three
    new `compare_chunked_*` tests panic with
    `assertion left == right failed: left: Err(InvalidCapacity)` —
    expected `Ok(true)` / `Ok(false)` / `Err(Timeout)` respectively. The
    bugged stub rejects whenever `expected.len() > chunk`, which is the
    pre-fix `verify` behavior the audit was opened against.
  - Post-GREEN host gate:
    `bazelisk test //target/ast10x0/peripherals:smc_flash_encoding_test`
    → PASS (20 tests pass).
  - Post-GREEN QEMU gate:
    `bazelisk test --config=virt_ast10x0 --test_tag_filters= //target/ast10x0/tests/smc:smc_device_qemu_program_erase_test //target/ast10x0/tests/smc:smc_device_test`
    → both PASS in ≤1.0s each.
- Notes/risk:
  - **Tactic deviation from §3.10 GREEN.** The plan's GREEN snippet
    inlines the chunk loop into `verify`. The actual GREEN extracts the
    loop into the free function `compare_chunked` (Option A) so the
    behavior is host-testable in isolation; `verify` is a one-line
    delegator. Functional behavior matches the inlined version.
  - **`compare_chunked` was introduced in the RED commit** rather than
    GREEN. The kernel `peripherals` library is built with
    `-D warnings`; an unused free function would have failed the build.
    Wiring `verify` to delegate immediately keeps the helper live without
    altering observable `verify` behavior — the RED stub matches the
    pre-fix `verify` (`Err(InvalidCapacity)` for `expected.len() > 256`),
    which is exactly the bug under audit.
  - **Chunk parameter clamping.** `compare_chunked` clamps `chunk` to
    its 256-byte scratch (`step = min(chunk, scratch.len())`). Callers
    cannot accidentally smuggle a larger comparison window in, so the
    "remains bounded and deterministic" acceptance criterion holds for
    any caller value, not just the one `verify` happens to pass.
  - Status: PASS.

## 8. Exit Criteria

Plan is complete when:
1. DEV-PAR-001..006 are all marked PASS.
2. Each requirement has linked tests and passing evidence.
3. No device-layer parity gaps remain open in `parity-gap-status.md`.
